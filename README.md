# MotivateMe

## A mobile app using Xamarin Forms 

### Project Description
#### Background
Hiya fellow coder :blush:. This was my first practice using Xamarin Forms (an open source cross-platform framework from Microsoft for building iOS, Android, & Windows apps with .NET from a single shared codebase). I thought it would be fun to create a mobile app intended for the somewhat lazy who want to do so much more :muscle:. Currently, this is a basic design and an ongoing project. Feel free to check out what I have so far! 
<br>
#### App Details
* Design and UI: Once the start button is tapped, the user will be directed to a page displaying three icons: Do it, Learn it, and Move it. The user can then choose how to be motivated for the day by tapping one of these icons.
* Programming language used: C# code-behind for behavior and functionality and XAML to define visual contents of each page
* Features I hope to implement in the future: more random fun facts and a reward/point system.<br>
### How to View My Project
