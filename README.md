# MotivateMe

## A mobile app using Xamarin Forms (an open source cross-platform framework from Microsoft for building iOS, Android, & Windows apps with .NET from a single shared codebase).
### Project Description
#### Background
Hiya fellow coder :blush:. This was my first practice using Xamarin Forms, and I thought it would be fun to create a mobile app intended for the somewhat lazy who want to do so much more :muscle:. The app includes features like a to-do list, a random fact generator, and some sort of "exercise" page.
<br><br>
#### App Details
* Tap start and you will be brought to a page displaying three icons: Do it, Learn it, and Move it. Tap an icon and choose how you want to motivate yourself today.
* I used XAML to define visual contents of each page and C# code-behind for behavior and functionality.
* Some features I hope to implement in the future: more random fun facts and a reward/point system.<br>
